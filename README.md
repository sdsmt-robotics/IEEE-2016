# IEEE-2016
Team Repository for the IEEE region 5 robotics competition.

Currently, this is where the framework for the autonomous locomotion, localization, and navigation code goes.

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/sdsmt-robotics/IEEE-2016/wiki) for this repo. It can be edited online and by cloning the *wiki* (not the IEEE-2016 repo, there's a separate one for the wiki) repository.
