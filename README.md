# IEEE-2016
Team Repository for the IEEE region 5 robotics competition.

**Repository structure changed** because branch method of organization is far too crazy. At Ian's suggestion, I've moved different pieces to their own repositories. This repository has the beginnings of the state machine and a currently non-working copy of Rem's joystick code. Functioning joystick code should go in the [joystick](https://github.com/sdsmt-robotics/joystick) repository.

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/sdsmt-robotics/IEEE-2016/wiki) for this repo. It can be edited online and by cloning the *wiki* (not the IEEE-2016 repo, there's a separate one for the wiki) repository.
