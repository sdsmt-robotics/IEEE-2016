# IEEE-2016
Team Repository for the IEEE region 5 robotics competition.

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/sdsmt-robotics/IEEE-2016/wiki) for this repo. It can be edited online and by cloning the *wiki* (not the IEEE-2016 repo, there's a separate one for the wiki) repository.

Rather than clutter this README, let's try to get all documentation posted on that wiki.
