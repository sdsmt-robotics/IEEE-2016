# IEEE-2016
Team Repository for the IEEE region 5 robotics competition.

We have a [wiki](https://github.com/SDMinesRobotics/IEEE-2016/wiki) for this repo. It can be edited online and by cloning the [`IEEE-2016.wiki`](https://github.com/SDMinesRobotics/IEEE-2016.wiki.git) repository.

Rather than clutter this README, let's try to get all documentation posted on that wiki.
